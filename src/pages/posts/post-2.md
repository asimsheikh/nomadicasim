## What would Indiana Jones do?
Becoming an adventurer in the Maghreb

‘You’re a world traveller’ said Michel. It was the first time I had heard the term. I was sitting in a town called Breda in the Netherlands. It was my first foray into Europe in 2014, I had gone to meet the tall handsome Dutchman, blue eyes, tall, dark hair and friendly bloke (guy for non Australian readers) in his early 20’s.  We had met  earlier in the year on the Island of Koh Rong Cambodia, Michel later recalled I was walking randomly over rocks trying to get to the undisturbed beach called Long Beach for over 2 hours, until I looked to my left and saw Michel and Bas simply walking along a path. They didn't look out of breath like I did. They had walked along a path on the left we had missed. I felt like we had a similar spirit, when we hiked in flip flops to get to a secluded beach, at one point I saw a Water Buffalo with his handler and turned to Michel, ‘I want to ride that water buffalo’, ‘We should’ he said, the handler looked at us like we were crazy. Michel was my type of guy, willing to try new things all the time.  

That term had haunted me since then until early 2017. I felt you had to earn that title, to have done something more than simply gone from country to country like a backpacker, taking buses and generally doing what most people did in their travels. Eat food, meet people, hike and climb things. For other backpackers, that meant hooking up, getting smashed on Alcohol and Drugs (something impermissible in my value system), going along the same tried and tested tourist routes. It had become pedestrian and unfilling to me within a year or two.

After three years of travel, I still felt like I didn't deserve that title. Most people who had met me by that stage were astonished. How long have you traveled for? It was one of the first two or three questions people asked when meeting each other for the first time on the road. It had started off simply being a 4 day trip to Thailand that I simply did because my best friend kept bugging me to go travel, I went simply to show him travelling was a waste of time and money. How wrong I was.

Back home people would ask me, what do you do out there alone? I was a solo traveller. There was no point relating my experiences, they wouldnt understand, to most people their vision of travel was a vacation with exotic locations and other sensory filled delights they would go through to escape from the monotony of their lives back home. Planned and curated to a tea, maybe with one or two tours thrown for the holiday pics back home, cooking classes, some pictures of old buildings, maybe buying a souvenir or two. Then back to the safety of their lives. 

I was doing something different out there I realized, something very different. 

After a tough year in 2015 and early 2016, launching a digital ground transport startup, I had burned myself out. Realizing that the world of startups and being an entrepreneur had very little to do with technical capability, and more about handling the never ending ups and downs of your emotional states, my best friend could see that I was exhausted. Again he recommended, go back overseas and attend some conferences and learn and network. So I had set out again, this time with a renewed focus. How can I build a more resilient mind, to launch something into the future.The next phase of journey was an exploration to find the tools and experiences that would allow me to attain that goal. Little did I know it would be the core theme of my journey. How to build a non-reactive mind?

I booked a trip to Cologne, Germany to meet up with an ex-flame. That did not go as expected. After a particular heated I argument I packed up my things and headed to Munich where I would meet up with Philipp Haertel, the first traveler I had ever met when I was in Europe. Who I would often affectionately refer to as ‘my little german brother’. Whenever I was in Europe I would go and see Philipp. I had been doing it every year for the past few years. In fact my deep knowledge of Deutschland and its people came from Philipp explaining all the aspects of their culture. I had grown tremendously fond of the people. 

I went past to see Michel in Den Bosch, Netherlands before heading back to Dusseldorf, Germany. During my talks with Philipp I had mentioned that there was a certain aspect of my life that I had neglected to develop as I was so focused on getting to the top of the corporate world. 

It was time to correct this. So I booked a flight to LA where I undertook a personal development course that was a two week immersion which cost me 10_000 dollars. During this course, some modules were about defining your values, defining a vision of what you would like to achieve in the next year. I found it particularly beneficial, not so much because of what was taught but rather because it allowed me to delve into the areas that I wanted to hit and the process was being facilitated by a person who had been mentored by Tony Robbins. In one on one I asked what I needed to learn from his course, what were my gaps, ‘Nothing’ he replied ‘You already have all the qualities you want, you just have to believe and take action’. I was a little miffed at this reply, so I asked him, that look he had in his eye, that presence, how he had built that. He said ‘Vipassana’. I asked what that was and he told me it was a gateway to building a non-reactive mind. I didn't really know what he was talking about but parked the knowledge in the back of my mind.


Fast forward two weeks, sitting in Lake Como, Italy for new years, I ended up having a movie like existence. Everything I wanted was happening. The depressed mind states from the previous year had vanished, and that had unleashed a wave of energy and excitement that I was able to channel into new thoughts, experiences and challenges.

I was traveling at this stage with a Texan I had met in Dusseldorf in December, William Munroe Harris IV.  An accountant in his early 30’s who had quit his job and was travelling around Europe. We had met in the hostel, and he had overheard me talking to a Scottish guy and said I was having a very intelligent, engaging conversation that he had really wanted to join. We hung out in Cologne, where I had returned to try and have a more mature conversation with my ex-flame, and when I departed for LA. 

I had a particular thought when I first met Will, could I take a brand new novice traveller and turn them into a world traveller in 3 months. It was a thought experiment I had run and I decided to see if I could make it happen. 

I messaged Will when I was in LA, ‘Where are you now?’, ‘Venice’ replied Will, ‘Ill come and meet you there’ I told will. So I flew from LA to Dusseldorf again, and flew from there to Venice. 

It was particularly cold at that time of the year, it was December and we were a few days away from Christmas. In the morning mists and canals of Venice we walked around and navigated the never ending labyrinth of waterways and streets we would talk about lives. I explained what I had learned in LA, and told some stories about how I accidentally got into travelling. 

Venice was particulary empty that time of the year, we would get lost and enage in the local markets, for me it was particulary captivating. Venice has a charm to it that is unique, you can almost feel the energy of the medieval people who built this town, in the buildings and the unique habits of the locals. We bought Parmasano Regianno, the king of cheeses. At one point Will wanted to go into an art exhibition late at night, we went in, saw some rather odd looking pieces and then walked into a room where a woman was clad semi naked dancing with a guy. Apparently this was ‘art’, something out of ‘Eyes Wide Shut’. Later on Will told me I was totally unimpressed by this side tour.

As I walked around the streets that feeling emerged again. The feeling of something is about to happen in the movie. I had obviously seen Venice in many movies, mostly strange romcoms and other avante garde european movies. However for me the most fond memory was Casino Royale with Daniel Craig. I had that little tingle of graditude again, I had been granted a dream of seeing something I had simply watched in the movies, never in my life thinking I would see it in real life. 

In our Pension we conversed with an Aussie from Brisbane, he was travelling around Europe. A particulary interesting story, he used to be a musician that turned it in and in his late 30’s decided to become a doctor. We had a particularly engaging conversation about life, at one point he even commented that he wouldnt talk to people often and found the depths of this conversation highly engaging.

I guess it was the dynamic between me and Will, I was using my new capabilities and extending them into the world and Will being reflecting would ask the right questions. Later on I realised that based on our Myers Briggs tests he was an INTJ and I was an ENTJ, personalities that seems to gel particulary well together.

Whilst grabbing a Pizza in one of the whole in the walls, what else does one do in Italy, it was time to decide what to do next. I had google maps open, and was looking at the nearest countries near me. Will had suggested that maybe we should do a roadtrip. I hadn’t really done one in ages but in my head I hatched a plan, why don't we just drive to Moscow from Italy. I knew that will had to be in Paris at some point to meet up with a British girl he had met in Budapest. 

When I told Will about the Moscow plan he said no way. But I knew that if we just kept going on the adventure country by country we could get close to the end of our trip. Looking on the map I could see the next country was Slovenia. I wondered what that place would look like. 

We have to go to Ljubljana to figure out how to say the word Ljubljana. We had a plan. We went from Venice to Bergamo airport and picked up the rental. I hadnt driven a stick shift in a while so it took some time to get used to it. At this stage for me driving on the right hand side of the road was no problem. We took the car and headed out to Slovenia. I was imagining it would look like something out of the Soviet block. Basically gray buildings and people wearing long coats with miserable looks on their faces. My only memories of the Balkans were from the 90’s war.

As we drove through the border, it was that rush of moving into Eastern Europe. Once we had officially crossed the border I went into the local petrol station to grab my traditional Coke and chips. However this time I noticed something unique and interesting. ‘Will look, they have a drink called Cokta, pretty sure its a replacement for coke’. It has become one of my favorite drinks. It tasted like some weird herbal mixture that reminded me of 100 Plus is Malaysia. It tasted terrible but after drinking it more than twenty times the taste grew on you.
